# ZooRações

Welcome to my project, from full-stack developer using PHP Laravel.

# Install the Project

Before, do you read Laravel Documetation it's much easier HAHAHA.
https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/installation

But, you can follow the codes below.

Obviously you will need to have PHP installed on your machine and the environment variables already configured.
And, you need install composer and Node.js in your computer.(composer global require laravel/installer)

Lest go to the codes.

After gitcloneing the project, you must run the following codes below:
cd example-app
npm install && npm run build
composer run dev

Now, we need to configure the .env file to run the database for the project to work.

.env example:

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=zooracoes
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
